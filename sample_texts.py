Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning.
Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised. Deep-learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, deep reinforcement learning, recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks have been applied to fields including computer vision,
speech recognition, natural language processing, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, material inspection and board game programs,
where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance. 
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems. 
ANNs have various differences from biological brains. Specifically, neural networks tend to be static and symbolic, while the biological brain of most living organisms 
is dynamic (plastic) and analogue. The adjective "deep" in deep learning refers to the use of multiple layers in the network. 
Early work showed that a linear perceptron cannot be a universal classifier, but that a network with a nonpolynomial activation function with one hidden layer of unbounded width can.
 Deep learning is a modern variation which is concerned with an unbounded number of layers of bounded size, which permits practical application and optimized implementation, while retaining theoretical universality under mild conditions. 
 In deep learning the layers are also permitted to be heterogeneous and to deviate widely from biologically informed connectionist models, for the sake of efficiency, trainability and understandability, whence the structured part.

At a Washington, D.C. farmers' market, lonely Sadie meets Cole, a romantically needy vendor. They share an enjoyable all-night date, culminating in sex, and Cole returns home but his texts to Sadie go unanswered. Cole's sister suspects she is "ghosting" him, but their parents convince him to surprise Sadie in London, after locating her via a tracker on his inhaler that he accidentally left in her bag.

In London, Cole is abducted to Pakistan by arms dealers who believe him to be legendary CIA operative "the Taxman". Before he can be tortured with insects to extract a passcode, he is rescued by Sadie, who reveals herself to be the Taxman. After a chase through the Khyber Pass, they escape Cole's captors, who are working for Leveque, a disgraced French Intelligence agent selling a stolen bio-weapon called "Aztec", for which he needs the passcode.

Reaching a nearby town, Cole and Sadie argue over their lies to each other, and meet Marco, her old contact and former lover. He warns Cole that Sadie cares more about the success of a mission than her boyfriends' lives, and agrees to take him home. Their plan is interrupted by a succession of bounty hunters after Leveque puts a price on Cole's head; Marco is killed, but the bounty hunters all kill each other. Learning that Leveque is seeking the passcode, Sadie is determined to recover Aztec using Cole as bait.

Sadie delivers Cole to Leveque, who leaves his henchman, Wagner, on a plane with Sadie, Cole, and the locked case containing Aztec. Their cover is blown when Wagner discovers a picture of the two in bed together on Cole's phone, but Cole parachutes to safety with the Aztec case and a wounded Sadie. Landing on Socotra Island, he uses his agricultural knowledge to treat her, reconnecting with her in the process. They are ambushed by Leveque's men, and Wagner escapes with the case while Cole and Sadie are rescued by U.S. Marines.

At CIA headquarters, Sadie is suspended for losing Aztec and tries to apologize for putting Cole in danger, but he is hurt by her commitment to her mission above all else. He helps to decipher the passcode, and agrees to continue to masquerade as the Taxman, luring Leveque with an offer to sell it.

Leveque meets Cole at a revolving restaurant with his own buyer for Aztec, Mr. Utami, and has the agents monitoring Cole killed. Sadie arrives, restoring Cole's trust in her, and sells the passcode to Mr. Utami instead for $10 million. She immediately uses the money to place a bounty on Leveque, and they are suddenly surrounded by bounty hunters.

A gunfight erupts, damaging the revolving mechanism and spinning the restaurant at high speed. Leveque shoots Utami, and Cole kills Wagner by throwing him into the mechanism. Sadie manages to send Leveque crashing through a window to his death, and narrowly saves the Aztec device. Rekindling their relationship, Sadie meets Cole's family, as they find time for each other between—and during—her missions.

horror_movie = """
TITLES UP: San Francisco, 1978. The words dissolve, and we 
hold on blackness. Hear soft eerie wind chimes. CUT TO:
EXT. HOUSE -- AFTERNOON
PUSH across a leaf-strewn lawn to find a GIRL, eight, with 
long braids, staring at an abandoned Victorian house that has 
fallen into grave disrepair. Shutters missing, paint 
peeling...an ingenue turned dowager by the march of time. 
Suddenly, a rock whizzes by the girl’s head and SHATTERS an 
upper story window. She turns and we finally SEE her face. 
This is ADELAIDE, and she has Down Syndrome.
TWO BOYS, TEN, bash a gate open with a baseball bat and strut 
into the yard. This is Troy and Bryan...the Rutger twins. 
TROY
Hey, retard.
They head into the empty derelict house, on a mission.
Adelaide suddenly speaks.
ADELAIDE
Excuse me.
They stop, turn.
ADELAIDE (CONT’D)
You’re going to die in there.
They stare at her a beat, the moment is shocking. Then Troy 
runs to her, viciously pushes her to the ground. He regards 
her, spits on her, then heads back into the house.
INT. HOUSE -- AFTERNOON
CLASSICAL music plays. FLASHLIGHT BEAMS illuminate stunning 
Victorian fixtures as they are shattered by the bat. Leaded 
stained glass, intricate moldings...the destruction is 
horrifying and complete, punctuated by the loud gunshot 
firecracker sound of SNAP and POPS the boys throw everywhere.
INT. KITCHEN -- AFTERNOON
Troy bashes stunningly beautiful leaded cabinets, shattering 
the glass. Suddenly, with alarm from another room --
BRYAN
Troy! 
2.
INT. LIVING ROOM -- AFTERNOON
We are on Troy’s face as he slowly makes his way across the 
empty room. All we HEAR is the sound of flies...a faint 
buzzing, then a cacophony. He finally stops near where his 
brother is standing and kneels down. 
TROY
Awesome.
He is looking at a dead gutted POSSUM...someone, something, 
has feasted here. The possum’s face is frozen and twisted in 
fear. ANGLE: the boys crouching reflection in the gray flat 
dead eye of the animal. Just then, a NOISE. Faint childish 
LAUGHTER. Adelaide? The boys investigate.
They walk down the hall, when suddenly a BASEMENT DOOR at the 
other end slowly creaks opens. The boys freeze, then --
TROY (CONT’D)
(afraid)
Go.
BRYAN
You go, shithead.
A dare. Troy moves forward. His brother follows.
INT. BASEMENT -- CONTINUOUS
A murky soup, the flashlights cut a swath.
The beams illuminate the odd stray cobweb, nothing much down 
here. The boys split up to investigate, Troy throwing the odd 
snap and pop. Until --
TROY
Check it out. 
Bryan approaches and stares with wonder. The flashlights 
illuminate a wall of dusty SPECIMEN JARS filled with yellow 
viscous fluid. Within the fluid: monstrosities. Severed 
deformed hands, feet, a twisted jaw...a horrifying tableau in 
the style of Joel Peter Witkin. 
Next to the jars: a neat line of surgical equipment. Clamps, 
disembowelers, spreaders...all caked in rusty blood.
A moment of awe from the boys. WE SEE (but they don’t) 
something move behind them. A flash of white.
Troy picks up one of the jars, studies, it.
3.
BRYAN
Don’t.
But Troy smashes it against a wall, it shatters.
TROY
It stinks down here. It stinks like 
shit.
(beat)
Last summer, when we had a raccoon 
stuck in the chimney? That’s what 
it smells like. Let’s go find it.
BRYAN
No, it smells bad. I’m going.
Bryan starts off. Troy starts investigating, throwing the 
snap and pops. Bryan is half way up the stairs, when the snap 
and pops ABRUPTLY STOP.
BRYAN (CONT’D)
Troy?
There is no sound. Then, a faint childish laugh.
BRYAN (CONT’D)
(freaked)
Who’s down here!
Silence. He moves down the creaking steps. Until his 
flashlight beam finds...
Troy...eyes wide with fear...his throat ripped out.
Terrified, Bryan feels something behind him. He hears a 
noise: breathing. He slowly turns, his beam ILLUMINATES:
A blonde two year old BOY, wearing a Lindberg-era white 
christening gown with seed pearls long yellowed. His mouth 
and face is smeared with blood, his skin is wrinkled like an 
ancient man. The INFANTATA smiles, gurgles...
Then ATTACKS.
The lightlight falls to the ground.
FADE TO BLACK.
A SINGLE WORD POPS UP: TODAY
INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- DAY
THE SOUND OF RUNNING WATER. Come up on a TRAY of 
INSTRUMENTS. 
4.
A stainless steel SPECULUM, a large SYRINGE with NEEDLE, 
COTTON SWABS, COTTON BALLS, RUBBER GLOVES. The water stops 
and the hands of DR. DAY come into view. He towels them off, 
pulls on the gloves. 
DR. DAY
Are your periods regular again?
He messes with the instruments as a WOMAN speaks. It’s VIVIEN 
HARMON. 
VIVIEN
Pretty much. Every other month.
Dr. Day turns. REVEAL Vivien, gowned, on her back, her legs 
in STIRRUPS. She’s pretty, forty, but she looks thirty five.
VIVIEN (CONT’D)
I’m not complaining. After all of 
that blood. 
Day inserts his gloved fingers into Vivien, beginning his 
exam. She takes in a sharp breath. 
VIVIEN (CONT’D)
Ben hates blood.
DR. DAY
How are you two doing? Sexual 
relations?
Day is clinical. He’s not looking to get off here.
VIVIEN
Sometimes. 
He inserts the speculum. She exhales. It hurts a little. 
DR. DAY
You having trouble with arousal?
VIVIEN
A little. Thought maybe it was pre￾menopause.
He pulls out the speculum, takes off his gloves.
DR. DAY
Could be. Any issues achieving 
climax? 
VIVIEN
I don’t know, it depends. When I’m 
alone it’s fine.
5.
He nods.
DR. DAY
Well, things look great from a 
physical standpoint. Are you 
anxious about having sex? About 
something happening?
VIVIEN
You mean like getting pregnant?
DR. DAY
It would be a normal response. 
VIVIEN
Well, I would like to go back on my 
birth control pills.
He takes out her FILE. Writes --
DR. DAY
I want to wait a beat on those. 
They can cause irregularities in 
your hormone levels and I think 
you’re already having some issues 
in that department. Your cycle, the 
sexual issues.
VIVIEN
I don’t have sexual issues.
(then)
Maybe I’m just depressed.
Day takes a beat, then keeps writing -- that’s not his field 
of expertise.
DR. DAY
I’ve recently had some success with 
women your age using bioidentical 
hormone treatments. Estrogen, 
progestin.
VIVIEN
Wait, so I am going through 
menopause?
DR. DAY
I don’t think so. This is more of 
a pre-emptive strike. Your body is 
like a house, you can fix the tiles 
in the bathroom and the kitchen but 
if the foundation is decaying, 
you’re wasting your time.
6.
VIVIEN
Are there any side effects?
DR. DAY
The bHRT’s are great for your skin, 
your organs. Most of the women I 
give these to tell me they make 
them feel ten years younger.
VIVIEN
I don’t let my family use plastic 
bottles or hold their cell phones 
to their ears, now you want me to 
put something in my body and not 
tell me side effects? Don’t they 
make those things with horse pee?
DR. DAY
Feel and look ten years younger.
VIVIEN
The arousal issue is mine, not 
Ben’s. I’m just reconnecting with 
my body after what happened, I 
don’t want to give it away again.
DR. DAY
You’re worried about losing 
control, I’m offering you something 
to help you get it back.
VIVIEN
I’m not a house.
DR. DAY
Vivien, what are you so afraid of?
Off Vivien, unsure of the answer --
INT. BACK BAY BROWNSTONE -- DAY
Vivien comes home with GROCERIES. Goes into the KITCHEN. 
Starts unloading. Along with the food is a LITTLE PHARMACY 
bag. She pulls out the hormone pills and creams, looks at 
them, thinks, then HEARS A NOISE from upstairs. A piece of 
furniture being moved? Her eyes go wide. Then, the sound 
again, longer, louder. She’s TERRIFIED, dials the phone. 911.
OPERATOR
911 operator, what is your 
emergency?
7.
VIVIEN
(whispering)
There’s someone in my house.
OPERATOR
Are you sure it’s not a member of 
your family?
VIVIEN
No. My daughter is at school and my 
husband is at work. I think someone 
is robbing us. Someone robbed the 
brownstone next door two weeks ago. 
What do I do?
OPERATOR
We’re sending a patrol car. 
She hears a THUNK -- like a body hitting the floor. She 
hangs up. Thinks. Grabs a KNIFE and starts upstairs.
INT. SECOND FLOOR -- CONTINUOUS 
ANGLE: on the gleaming knife at her side. More sounds. Vivien 
slowly makes her way to the door, takes a deep breath and 
CREAKS it open. On her face, the blood rushing out of it.
GIRL’S VOICE (O.S.)
Oh shit.
Vivien backs out into the hallway, almost goes over the 
railing. She’s going to throw up. Before she can, her 
husband, BEN comes out, naked. He’s 42, fit, handsome as she 
is pretty. 
BEN
Vivien.... 
He goes to hug her. She instinctively SLASHES at him with the 
knife. It SCRAPES his arm. Both of them look at the small, 
yet real wound, shocked. She drops the knife. He takes her 
in his arms and keeps repeating with hysteria...
BEN (CONT’D)
I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry...
She lets him hold her for a beat, then breaks away in tears 
and runs down the stairs. Off a naked, bleeding Ben we SMASH 
TO BLACK.
INT. CAR -- DAY
DRIVING OVER THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE, SIX MONTHS LATER. Hard 
SUNLIGHT through the windows. Ben’s driving. 
8.
Vivien in the passenger seat, staring out the window. Their 
fifteen year old GOTH daughter VIOLET in the back with six 
month old DOG, HALLIE.
BEN
Isn’t it beautiful?
VIVIEN
The light is different from Boston. 
Feels like I can see more. I 
thought it was supposed to be all 
foggy.
VIOLET
I need to go to the bathroom.
BEN
It’s just a little while longer.
VIOLET
I need to go.
BEN
Where would you like me to pull 
over, sweetie -- the Bay or the 
Pacific?
VIOLET
(re: the dog)
Bet if baby substitute had to shit 
you’d find somewhere.
VIVIEN
I don’t like that word, Violet.
A beat, then Violet looks out the window. Thoughtfully --
VIOLET
Thirteen hundred people have jumped 
off of this thing -- at least 
that’s what they think. They don’t 
see them all and they stopped 
counting right before a thousand. 
I looked it up. Twenty six of them 
survived. You know what all of 
them said was their first thought 
after they stepped off? 
(then, mischievous)
Oh shit.
Her mother’s discomfort makes Violet grin.
9.
VIOLET (CONT’D)
Kind of how I feel about this move.
(then)
I’m not going to like the school. 
San Francisco is filled with 
hippies and freaks and drug 
addicts.
BEN
I’m glad we named you Violet 
instead of our second choice.
VIOLET
Which was?
BEN
Sunshine.
They all kind of crack up. A fleeting moment of family 
togetherness. Ben shares a smile with his wife, then reaches 
out his hand to hold hers, but she PULLS it AWAY.
EXT. OLD VICTORIAN HOUSE -- DAY
They pull into the driveway. Everyone takes a good look -- 
it’s looking better than it did the last time we saw it. New 
paint, shutters, gutters. There’s a FOR SALE sign on the 
lawn. All three of them take it in as they come to a stop.
BEN
This is it.
Vivien is unsure. Violet is intrigued. MARCY, the RELATOR 
greets them from the front porch with a WAVE.
INT. HOUSE -- DAY
Marcy shows them around. The FOYER is epic, beautiful, 
soaring ceilings and a grand STAIRCASE. House porn. 
MARCY
It’s the finest Queen Anne on the 
market. Venetian chandeliers, 
original moldings. The stained 
glass is some of the only of it’s 
kind that survived the great quake. 
As you can see the previous owners 
really loved the place like a 
child. They restored everything.
VIVIEN
Gay?
10.
MARCY
Sweetheart, it’s San Francisco, 
they’re all gay.
Light laughter. Except from Violet, who rolls her eyes. Ben 
sees this and fights a laugh. They head into the KITCHEN.
INT. KITCHEN
It’s beautiful. Looks original except with all of the modern 
bells and whistles. 
MARCY
Do you cook?
BEN
Viv is a great cook. I got her 
cooking lessons a few years ago for 
her birthday and she ended up 
teaching the teacher a few things.
MARCY
Cooking lessons. Romantic. You’re 
a psychiatrist?
BEN
Psychologist. You said something on 
the phone about there being a study 
upstairs that I could use as a home 
office? I’m planning on seeing 
patients here so I can spend more 
time with the family.
MARCY
How refreshing.
Vivien shakes her head. 
INT. HALLWAY -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS
Hallie sniffs around, PEES in a corner, then SENSES 
SOMETHING. Explores, then -- STARTS BARKING LIKE CRAZY.
INT. KITCHEN
Violet is staring out the window at the BACKYARD.
VIVIEN
Violet, will you go see what’s 
going on with Hallie?
Violet storms out. Teenager.
11.
INT. HALLWAY
Violet finds Hallie, barking madly at the BASEMENT DOOR. 
VIOLET
Shut up!
She won’t. Violet looks at the door. It’s BOLTED SHUT. Old 
school bolted. Two heavy bolts and two HUGE PADLOCKS. 
Someone doesn’t want to let anyone in -- or maybe out. 
Violet wiggles the doorknob, trying to pry it open.
INT. BASEMENT -- DAY
From the BOTTOM of the steps. POV of something watching the 
door move, the knob jiggle. We hear it’s raspy breathing.
INT. HALLWAY
Violet tries the door a few more times, then yanks on the 
locks. No luck. She stares at the door, oddly drawn to it. 
INT. LIBRARY -- DAY
Marcy shows Vivien and Ben the BEAUTIFUL GOTHIC LIBRARY. 
MARCY
This is my favorite room in the 
house. 
BEN
(to Vivien, trying)
When I saw the pictures of this 
room online I thought maybe you 
could use it as your music room.
MARCY
You’re a musician?
VIVIEN
I was.
BEN
She’s a cellist. She played in the 
Boston philharmonic.
She heads over to the WALL. Something isn’t right.
MARCY
Why did you quit?
There’s an answer, but we’re not going to get it.
12.
VIVIEN
This wallpaper is coming off.
She goes to the wall, grabs a tiny PEELING PIECE of seagrass 
wallpaper and gently pulls it off. It opens a small window to 
the ORIGINAL WALL, no bigger than a couple of postage stamps. 
VIVIEN (CONT’D)
I think there’s a mural under here.
MARCY
The last owners must have covered 
it up. They were modernists.
(then, with difficulty)
Speaking of the last owners, full 
disclosure requires me to tell you 
about what happened to them.
VIVIEN
Oh God, one of them didn’t die in 
here, did they?
MARCY
Yes, actually. Both of them.
(off their shock)
Murder suicide. I sold them the 
house, too. Just the sweetest 
couple. You never know I guess.
BEN
So that’s why it’s half the price 
of every other house in the 
neighborhood.
MARCY
I have a very nice painted lady not 
too far from here but you’re going 
to get a third of the house for 
twice the price if you go that way.
Vivien and Ben aren’t sure. Violet comes in carrying Hallie.
VIOLET
Where did it happen?
MARCY
The basement.
Another beat. Violet grins.
VIOLET
We’ll take it.
Off Ben and Vivien --
13.
EXT. HOUSE - EVENING
As MOVERS finish bringing the last boxes in, Marcy pulls the 
IN ESCROW sign off of the FOR SALE sign and replaces it with 
one that says SOLD.
INT. HOUSE -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT
Ben comes out the bathroom in his pajamas, happy. Vivien is 
still unpacking, there are boxes everywhere. He comes in 
behind her, kisses her, she gently moves away.
BEN
Come to bed, we’ll finish this in 
the morning.
VIVIEN
I’m worried about Violet. She’s 
right about kids being different 
out here. She can’t handle another 
year of not fitting in.
BEN
You mean you can’t.
(then)
I treat kids like Violet every day. 
In three months she’ll have lost 
all of the dark eye make up and 
combat boots and be walking around 
in Birkenstocks with unshaven pits 
smelling like patchouli.
She laughs. He takes her in his arms.
VIVIEN
It doesn’t freak you out at all? 
What happened here?
BEN
My repulsion is tempered by the 
fact that this house is worth four 
times what we paid for it.
VIVIEN
But it’s not like some old lady 
died in here. A murder-suicide. 
Gives me the creeps just thinking 
about it.
BEN
So don’t think about it.
14.
VIVIEN
That’s your professional advice, 
doctor?
BEN
No place is perfect. No place and 
no person.
(then)
All I know is that for the first 
time in months I feel at home 
somewhere. Moving here, buying this 
house was the right thing to do for 
our family. It’s a good thing and 
frankly, we deserve some good after 
all the shit we’ve been through.
(then, realizing)
Sorry.
She nods, not sure, but desperate to trust him. He kisses 
her. Another fleeting moment, this one of marital bliss, but 
she can’t sustain it. She pulls away, leaves him to go do 
more unpacking. 
EXT. SCHOOL COURTYARD -- DAY
Violet walks through the commons, SMOKING. She surveys the 
scene -- a few kids reliving their grandparents’ Haight 
Ashbury fashion mistakes but most are unmemorable. Upper 
middle class high school in an upscale urban neighborhood. 
She passes THREE pretty girls -- seniors dressed like they’re 
twenty-five -- talking up some boys -- LEAH, BECCA and ABBY. 
Overhears their conversation --
LEAH
So I let him.
BECCA
Do coke off of your nipples?
LEAH
They were numb for like two days.
They all crack up. Violet tries to disappear into her sweater 
as she passes, but --
LEAH (CONT’D) 
Hey! Student council passed a rule 
against smoking in public spaces.
The girls step in front of her.
BECCA
Second hand smoke kills.
15.
Violet puts the cigarette out. 
VIOLET
I didn’t know. I’m new.
Violet nervously flicks her butt into a planter. Leah flips.
LEAH
What the hell is the matter with 
you? People sit here. They eat
here.
VIOLET
You don’t know me. Why are you 
doing this?
BECCA
Leah’s grandma died of lung cancer. 
She takes this stuff pretty 
seriously.
Leah holds the butt out to Violet.
LEAH
Eat it.
(off Violet’s shock)
Eat it. Or I’m going to kick the 
shit out of you.
ABBY
Come on, Leah, it’s enough.
LEAH
No, I want to see her eat it.
She grabs Violet’s face.
BECCA
Seriously, Leah, she’s like twelve.
Leah starts trying to shove the cigarette into Violet’s 
mouth, but Violet resists, then instinctively SPITS in Leah’s 
face. That stuns everyone. Abby and Becca can’t help but 
laugh. A beat, then Violet takes off running.
LEAH
(calling after her)
You’re dead! DEAD!
16.
INT. HOUSE -- MUSIC ROOM -- DAY
Vivien drops the NEEDLE on an old record player. Classical 
cello plays as she sets out her INSTRUMENTS -- a large bowl 
of water, scraping tool, small knife. Slowly and carefully, 
she starts removing the old wallpaper. 
As she does, the GOYA-ESQUE MURAL begins to reveal itself. 
She can’t quite make out the first image -- until she pulls 
off one more sliver or paper to see -- A WOMAN, her face bent 
in pain, her body twisted and tortured. 
Vivien stares at the image, transfixed and disturbed when 
suddenly a HAND touches her shoulder. She jumps out of her 
skin, turns, sees ADELAIDE, the child with Down Syndrome we 
saw earlier, now a woman in her forties.
ADELAIDE
You’re going to die in here.
CONSTANCE (O.S.)
Adelaide!
Constance, Adelaide’s mother enters from the kitchen carrying 
a BOX. Constance is a chain smoker, and she sounds like it. 
CONSTANCE (CONT’D)
Adelaide. I put that “Dora the 
Explorer” on for you so you would 
sit and watch it. 
ADELAIDE
It was “Go Diego Go.” I don’t like 
it.
CONSTANCE
Brown cartoon characters -- you 
can’t tell the difference.
Vivien doesn’t know what to make of this. Finally --
CONSTANCE (CONT’D)
Hi. Hi. I’m Constance your neighbor 
-- the tear down next door. This 
is my girl Adelaide. Go home Addy.
Now!
Adelaide storms out.
CONSTANCE (CONT’D)
That girl is a monster. I love her 
and I’m a good Christian but Jesus 
H. 
(MORE)
17.
CONSTANCE (CONT’D)
Christ, if they’d invented some of 
those tests a few years earlier...
VIVIEN
How did you get in my house?
CONSTANCE
You left your back door open, 
though I have to warn you Addy 
seems to always find a way in. 
She’s got a bug up her ass for this 
place, always has. You got a dog?
VIVIEN
Yes. Is that a problem?
CONSTANCE
Better for me. I run a little 
kennel out of my house. Doggy day 
care kind of thing. Don’t bother 
calling the cops on me -- I’m in 
with one of the city managers and 
he always looks the other way.
VIVIEN
Look, it’s very nice to meet you 
but I wasn’t really prepared for 
company.
CONSTANCE
I’m gone. Brought this for you, 
housewarming. Addy wanted to cook 
you a pie but she tends to spit in 
the cooking so I figured this was 
better -- should help you get rid 
of some of the bad ju-ju.
She hands Vivien the box.
CONSTANCE (CONT’D)
Those homosexual boys were nice 
enough and I say live and let live, 
but I can’t help but think that 
that lifestyle drove them to do 
what they did. 
(then)
I can’t remember your name.
VIVIEN
I didn’t tell you. I’m Vivien 
Harmon.
